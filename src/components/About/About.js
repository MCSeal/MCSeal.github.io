                Hi I'm Mathew Seal, I've always enjoyed technology/science and as a result I went to school and received a diploma for Biotechnology, 
                and then a bachelors degree in Biology where; notably I also took the first year of Computer Science as electives; just for fun.
                Since then I've worked several years on medical devices in this field, first with a start-up and then with a large corporation.

                While pandemic restrictions surged across my country, I decided to thoroughly expand my skill-set by jumping into the world of Web development. I was stuck at home, I thought I might as well
                make use of it!
