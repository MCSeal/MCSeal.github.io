      Hello my name is Mathew Seal, I originally went to school for
      Biotechnology and then Biology. I also took the first year of Computer
      Science as electives; just for fun. For the last few years I have been
      expanding my skill-set by jumping into the world of Web Development and
      Web Technologies. With various technologies under my belt, and an interest
      and curiosity to expand it; I would love the opportunity to work with you.
